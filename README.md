// BRIEFING

This is the Window Website for Studio Ottico Leone, one of the oldest opticians in Turin.
<br><br>
The visual identity of this website is inspired by the classic optician tools such as the optometric table and the refractometer - hence the clean sharp lines and the prevalence of black and white.
<br><br>
Sporadic touches of color bring movement and excitement, to reflect the enthusiastic personality of Andrea, the owner, and his colorful frames.
